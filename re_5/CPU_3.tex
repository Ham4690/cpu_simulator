表\ref{tab:list}に一方向連結リストプログラムソースコードを示す.mem[100]へdata,mem[101]へnextとして考え.スタート位置はmem[100H]をスタート位置とした.\\
dataが格納されているメモリの隣にアドレスを格納しており、アドレスをIXへ格納して次のdataを参照するようになっている.dataはACCへ格納後,これまで参照した最大値が格納されているメモリ(mem[1ffH])と比較しACCの方が大きければ入れ替え動作を行う.\\
NULLは00Hとしnextで参照した先が00の場合終了する.
表\ref{tab:list}に示すのデータ構造を以下に示す.
\newpage
以下に結果を示す.
結果よりmem[1ffH]へ最大値の04Hが格納され終了しているためプログラムは正しく実行されたと確認できる.

\section{演習}
  \subsection{演習4}
  教育用CPUボードでもJR,JAL命令を用いなくてもサブルーチンを実現することは可能だと考える.理由としては関数に飛ぶ際にフラグ用のメモリを用意し関数(サブルーチン)を用いる際は1にして条件 Branch命令を用いて関数の動作内容が記述されている部分にPCを変更する.事前に戻る位置のPCはどこかのメモリに記録しておき,戻る前にフラグ用のメモリを0へ戻してBranch命令を用い戻るいちを記録したメモリを参照しPCを変更させることにより実現できると考えた.
\section{考察}
cpuシミュレータ作成実習を通して,各マシン命令を作成することによってフェーズ毎の動作を知ることができた.メモリを意識しながらプログラムを行うことによってC言語のポインタに対する考えが深まった.普段pythonやc言語などを用いるためマシン語でコーディングする際に理解しにくくミスが増えプログラミングの効率が悪く時間も多くかかってしまった,現在利用されている言語は人間が用いる言葉に近い形で記述することができより良い形に使用される言語も変化しているのだと感じられた.
